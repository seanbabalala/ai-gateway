# Quickstart

This guide starts the open-source SiftGate Data Plane on one machine with memory state and SQLite.

## 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanbabalala/ai-gateway.git
cd ai-gateway
npm install
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

## 2. Configure

```bash
cp gateway.config.example.yaml gateway.config.yaml
cp .env.example .env
```

SiftGate loads `.env` automatically for local startup. Edit `gateway.config.yaml`
and add or verify one upstream node. Prefer runtime secret references such as
`${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}` instead of committing secrets. Legacy
`${OPENAI_API_KEY}` startup interpolation still works, but it is required at
startup and reload time; use `${OPENAI_API_KEY:-dummy}` only when you
intentionally want a fallback value.

## 3. Build And Run

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

On first startup, SiftGate generates an initial Dashboard password, logs it
once, and stores only its bcrypt hash in `gateway.config.yaml`.

Open:

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:2099/dashboard`
- API docs: `http://localhost:2099/docs`
- Health: `http://localhost:2099/health`

## 4. Finish The First-Run Path

The v2.8 Dashboard opens with a first-run setup path:

1. Confirm or create the active Workspace.
2. Add or verify one Provider Node.
3. Create a Gateway API Key for client apps.
4. Optionally add a Policy Namespace when keys or Teams need shared node, model, budget, or rate-limit policy.
5. Review daily Budget scopes for Global, Policy Namespace, Team, and API Key.
6. Send a first request from Playground or an OpenAI-compatible client.
7. Open logs, route evidence, and cost metadata.
8. Explore advanced setup for Semantic Controls, Traffic Experiments, Eval Reports, Shadow Traffic, and MCP Tool Gateway only when you need those features.

Policy Namespace and advanced setup are optional. The required path is
Workspace, Provider Node, Gateway API Key, Budget review, first request, and
evidence review.

This checklist is metadata-only. It does not store prompts, responses, raw
headers, provider keys, media bytes, tool payloads, hidden reasoning, or
resolved secrets.

## 5. Send A Request

```bash
curl http://localhost:2099/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ${SIFTGATE_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello from SiftGate."}]
  }'
```

## 6. Five-Minute Governed Request

Use this path when evaluating SiftGate against a lightweight proxy or API
distribution panel. The goal is to prove that one request is governed, routed,
logged, and explainable without turning on advanced features.

1. Open `http://localhost:2099/dashboard`.
2. Confirm one Workspace exists.
3. Add or verify one Provider Node with a runtime secret reference such as
   `${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}`.
4. Create one Gateway API Key with:
   - `allowed_endpoints`: `chat_completions` or `messages`
   - `allowed_nodes`: the node you just verified
   - `allowed_models`: one model or alias
   - optional daily token or cost budget
5. Send the request with that Gateway API key.
6. Open **Logs** and confirm the request id, node, model, status, latency,
   token/cost metadata, and API key attribution.
7. Open **Route Explanation** for the request and confirm why SiftGate selected
   or rejected candidates.

This is the smallest SiftGate loop: client key, provider key separation,
endpoint/model policy, budget context, route evidence, and metadata-only logs.
It is intentionally separate from public API resale, prepaid wallets, or channel
redistribution workflows.

## 7. Validate Before Production

```bash
npm run validate:config
npm run docs:check
npm test -- --runInBand
```
