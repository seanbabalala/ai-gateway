# Current Engineering Baseline

Reviewed: 2026-09-20
Release: **v2.11.5**

This is the current engineering baseline for the open-source data plane. The
[July optimization plan](reports/optimization-plan-2026-07-14.md) is historical
execution evidence, not the current work queue.

## Source And Release Identity

- The annotated `v2.11.5` tag is the release source of truth. Compare full commit
  IDs, not just package versions: earlier deployment fixes shared v2.11.4.
- This release starts from main commit `8f12730c` (PR #130), retaining native
  Messages server tools, citations, signed thinking history, tool intent, and
  usage metadata.
- Previously deployed transport-cause diagnostics and configurable per-model
  circuit breakers are now part of the maintained source and regression tests.
- Default breaker behavior is unchanged: enabled, three consecutive failures,
  30-second cooldown, and one configured half-open probe slot. Existing local
  configuration is not rewritten by the release.
- The macOS 2099 watchdog helper is tracked. It is not installed, started, or
  invoked by builds or release checks; deployments must review its launchd
  label and local paths before adopting it.

## Repeatable Quality Gates

Local verification on 2026-09-20 completed the 17-step release-hardening gate:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Backend/SDK unit discovery | 114 suites, 1,669 tests passed; one optional PostgreSQL suite/test skipped |
| Backend E2E | 13 suites, 115 tests passed |
| Dedicated TypeScript SDK | 2 suites, 6 tests passed; build and typecheck passed |
| Python SDK | 7 tests passed |
| Backend/runtime-plugin build, lint, config, Kubernetes, registry | Passed |
| Docs, public-boundary scan, version sync | Passed |
| Frontend static checks, build, bundle budgets | Passed |
| Production dependency audit | Passed the configured critical-severity gate; lower-severity advisories remain |

Cloud CI results belong to the release commit's GitHub checks. Runtime health
and deployment evidence must be recorded separately after the planned restart.

Run `npm run release:hardening` from the repository root. It includes backend
build/unit/E2E checks, configuration and Kubernetes validation, zero-warning
lint, documentation/public-boundary/version checks, provider registry checks,
SDK checks, dependency auditing, and frontend checks/build/bundle budgets.

Jest now has explicit discovery roots:

| Command | Maintained test scope |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test -- --runInBand` | `src`, `test` (excluding E2E), and `packages/client` |
| `npm run test:e2e` | `test/e2e` only |
| `npm run test:sdk` | TypeScript client tests only |

Generated worktrees under `output` and caches under `.local-dev` are not test
roots. Regression tests exercise real Jest discovery against both types of
artifacts, including duplicate package names. Frontend `npm test` consists of
static source/i18n/contract checks; it is not a browser-rendering or interaction
test suite.

Real PostgreSQL row-lock coverage is conditional locally. The separate
Postgres Budget Smoke CI workflow provisions an isolated service database.
Docker smoke is likewise a separate CI gate. Do not report skipped local
integration checks as passed.

The dependency audit gate retains the existing `--audit-level=critical`
threshold. Passing it does not mean there are no lower-severity advisories;
dependency upgrades require separate review and are not bundled into this
source/runtime alignment release.

## Runtime Alignment Without An Early Restart

A checkout, a published tag, and a running process are distinct identities.
The process command and active release manifest identify what is actually
serving requests; a repository-local `dist` directory does not establish that.

1. Record the active PID, resolved release directory, config checksum, and
   release-manifest checksums. Keep machine paths and configuration private.
2. Preserve local changes before synchronizing source. Review deployed patches
   against the release branch rather than overwriting them with an older build.
3. Build and validate in an isolated worktree. Do not run dependency installs
   or replace frontend assets through links used by the live process.
4. Merge passing changes, publish the annotated tag and GitHub release, and
   prepare an immutable candidate with commit/version and file checksums.
5. Leave the active runtime untouched until the scheduled restart. Verify
   in-flight work, preserve a rollback release, then switch and restart once.
6. Verify the new PID, readiness, release checksums, and unchanged config.
   Record the deployed release separately from the GitHub release.

Never store provider credentials, Gateway keys, request/response bodies, or
resolved secrets in public provenance or release notes.

## Evidence Limits And Next Optimization Work

- The committed v2.0.0 performance report uses one measured request per
  scenario. It is historical harness smoke evidence, not a statistically
  useful p95/p99 or current-version capacity baseline. No new latency,
  throughput, or SLA claim is made by v2.11.5.
- Before performance optimization, capture repeated warm runs with sufficient
  samples, fixed concurrency, hardware, config, commit, and upstream behavior.
  Separate gateway overhead from upstream latency and first non-empty content
  from the first SSE byte. See [Performance](PERFORMANCE.md).
- A healthy HTTP endpoint establishes only the checks it actually performs.
  If circuit breaking and active probes are disabled, it does not demonstrate
  that every upstream can currently complete model requests.
- Continue with protocol/stream/tool/usage regression coverage and measured
  bottlenecks rather than reopening completed July work or adding features
  without a reproducible baseline.
