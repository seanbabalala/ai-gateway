# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 2.8.0-alpha.1 - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Added shared Dashboard concept helper panels for Workspace, Policy Namespace, Gateway API Keys, Semantic Controls, Traffic Experiments, Eval Reports, Shadow Traffic, MCP Tool Gateway, budget scopes, fixed OSS member roles, and Provider Catalog visibility.
- Added shared Dashboard capability/status language: Read-only, Config-driven, Preview, OSS fixed roles, Runtime-supported, and Requires config, with seven-locale copy for `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`.
- Added `docs/OSS_CONCEPTS.md` to explain Workspace vs Policy Namespace vs Team vs Gateway API Key vs Node vs Provider.

### Changed

- Renamed user-facing Dashboard copy from Semantic Platform to Semantic Controls, Experiments to Traffic Experiments, MCP Gateway to MCP Tool Gateway, and Namespace to Policy Namespace where it describes policy scope.
- Clarified empty states and helper copy for config-driven surfaces so OSS users can tell when data requires existing routing, namespace, MCP, eval, shadow, provider, or budget configuration.
- Updated Dashboard, namespace/shadow, MCP, semantic, eval, provider catalog, README, and release metadata for v2.8.0-alpha.1.

### Boundaries

- v2.8.0-alpha.1 is a product-clarity release only. It does not change runtime behavior, schemas, routing, budgets, MCP proxying, provider projection, auth, Workspace CRUD, Policy Namespace CRUD, or privacy defaults.

## 2.7.1 - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Reorganized the Dashboard sidebar into Monitor, Runtime, Intelligence, Agents & Tools, and Governance groups so observability, runtime configuration, intelligence surfaces, agent tooling, and administration follow a clearer operator workflow.
- Added seven-locale Dashboard group labels for the new sidebar information architecture.
- Updated release metadata to v2.7.1 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, release-version sync coverage, and benchmark script expectations.

- Context Window Optimizer records trim/summarize evidence in v2.7 but does not silently mutate prompt content.
- Guardrails v2 records metadata-only findings by default and does not replace the official guardrails plugin for deeper local enforcement.

## 2.6.0 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added the v2.6 Cost And Chargeback Platform for the OSS data plane: workspace-scoped internal chargeback summaries, CSV/JSON exports, budget period close metadata, cost anomaly detection, provider price sync governance, and thumbs feedback aggregation.

- Added `GET /api/dashboard/agent-platform`, a read-only Dashboard endpoint that combines Agent Profiles, Gateway API key policy, MCP server/tool metadata, and call-log agent span metadata without executing tools or running workflows.
- Added a Dashboard **Agent Platform** page with seven-locale copy for `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`, plus static frontend checks for the route, hook, API types, privacy copy, and locale coverage.
- Added `docs/AGENT_PLATFORM_PREVIEW.md` and updated API, Dashboard, Architecture, Coding Agent Gateway, MCP Gateway, and README docs with the v2.5 preview boundaries.

### Changed

- Updated release metadata to v2.5.0 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, release-version sync coverage, and benchmark script expectations.

### Boundaries

- v2.5.0 does not add a full workflow builder, DAG runtime, hosted tool marketplace, cloud dependency, or automatic tool execution from the Dashboard.
- Agent Platform Preview does not store prompts, responses, source code, diffs, tool inputs, tool outputs, raw provider headers, provider keys, Gateway API key plaintext, media bytes, hidden reasoning text, or resolved secrets by default.
- Agent and tool routing still goes through existing Gateway API key, workspace, namespace, endpoint/model/node, rate-limit, budget, MCP, and routing policy enforcement.

## 2.4.0 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added the v2.4 Provider Ecosystem Expansion batch with source-governed built-in catalog rows for DeepInfra, Nebius AI Studio, Novita AI, FriendliAI, Databricks Mosaic AI, and GitHub Models.
- Added Dashboard provider identity metadata for the v2.4 provider batch so OpenAI-compatible providers keep their own logos/badges instead of falling back to generic OpenAI identity.
- Added `npm run provider-registry:check`, an offline community provider manifest validation check with a review-required fixture for provider shape, endpoint/model evidence, pricing source governance, and secret hygiene.
- Added provider catalog and provider extensibility docs describing the v2.4 batch, registry CI expectations, and the continued requirement for reviewed local overrides before production cost routing.

### Changed

- Marked the v2.4 batch as transport/review metadata where model availability, workspace endpoints, marketplace access, or account-specific pricing can change outside SiftGate.
- Updated release metadata to v2.4.0 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

### Boundaries

- v2.4.0 does not promise 100+ provider coverage and does not add untested provider rows for count inflation.
- Built-in/community pricing remains review-required reference metadata unless a trusted operator override supplies high-confidence pricing.
- Provider Ecosystem Expansion does not store prompts, responses, raw provider headers, provider keys, Gateway API key plaintext, media bytes, source code, diffs, tool payloads, hidden reasoning text, or resolved secrets by default.

## 2.3.0 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added the v2.3 Provider Extensibility release for the OSS data plane: custom provider templates, custom-header auth, Provider SDK Generator beta, community registry design, and Provider Health Dashboard v1.
- Added `POST /api/dashboard/provider-extensibility/templates/custom/preview` for read-only custom-provider node/catalog manifest previews with secret placeholders and manual-review evidence.

- Added `GET /api/dashboard/provider-health` for workspace-scoped provider/node availability, probe status, circuit state, latency, error rate, compatibility labels, auth metadata, and pricing-source warnings.
- Added Dashboard Nodes support for `custom-header` auth mapping plus provider health summary cards with seven-locale copy for `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`.
- Added `docs/PROVIDER_EXTENSIBILITY.md` plus Provider Catalog, Adding Providers, API Reference, Dashboard, and README documentation for v2.3 operations.

### Changed

- Provider clients, active health probes, node test APIs, config validation, catalog validation, and Dashboard node DTOs now understand `auth_type: custom-header` with `auth_header_name` and optional `auth_header_prefix`.
- Custom provider previews and generated manifests keep pricing as review-required operator metadata and do not auto-trust generated adapters or community pricing.
- Provider Health uses existing probes, circuit breakers, call logs, compatibility metadata, and pricing governance instead of adding a raw-content health store.
- Updated release metadata to v2.3.0 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

### Boundaries

- v2.3.0 does not promise 100+ provider coverage, scrape provider pricing, or merge generated adapters without review and tests.
- Provider Extensibility and Provider Health do not store prompts, responses, raw provider headers, provider keys, Gateway API key plaintext, media bytes, source code, diffs, tool payloads, hidden reasoning text, or resolved secrets by default.
- Generated SDK artifacts are returned to the caller as beta scaffolds only; SiftGate does not write them to disk or trust them as runtime providers automatically.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added the v2.2 Intelligence Loop for the OSS data plane: Real-time Cost Optimizer v1, Token Prediction v1, Async Eval metadata, and disabled-by-default Quality Gate v1.
- Added privacy-safe `intelligence` route-decision evidence for optimizer candidates, token estimates, budget risk, quality gate events, and async eval queue state.
- Added metadata columns on call logs and route decisions for optimizer applied state, estimated cost/savings, token prediction risk, quality gate status, and async eval queued state.
- Added `GET /api/dashboard/intelligence/summary` for metadata-only optimizer, token risk, async eval, and quality gate summaries grouped by agent and node.
- Added Dashboard Overview and Route Explanation surfaces for Intelligence Loop evidence with seven-locale copy for `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`.
- Added `docs/INTELLIGENCE_LOOP.md` plus config example, API reference, Dashboard, and architecture documentation for v2.2 operations.

### Changed

- Cost optimization remains evidence-only unless `intelligence.cost_optimizer.action=optimize` is explicitly configured.
- Token Prediction can reject or request downgrade only through explicit budget policy; default behavior records evidence without changing traffic.
- Quality Gate retries/fallbacks are limited to non-streaming responses before bytes are sent. Streaming requests record a `streaming_no_post_start_retry` skip reason.
- Updated release metadata to v2.2.0 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

### Boundaries

- Intelligence Loop does not store prompts, responses, raw provider headers, provider keys, Gateway API key plaintext, source code, diffs, tool payloads, MCP payloads, media bytes, hidden reasoning text, or resolved secrets by default.
- Async Eval v1 is metadata-only by default and does not make inline eval mandatory.
- Optimizer and token prediction do not bypass workspace isolation, RBAC, Gateway API key permissions, endpoint/model/node policy, budgets, circuit breakers, or fallback policy.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added the v2.1 Coding Agent Gateway release for the OSS data plane: workspace-scoped Agent Profiles now render governed setup snippets for Cursor, Cline, Roo Code, Continue, Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Generic OpenAI-compatible coding agents, and Generic Anthropic-compatible coding agents.
- Added coding-agent virtual model aliases `coding-auto`, `coding-fast`, `coding-deep`, and `coding-security`, mapped to internal smart-routing hints without forcing one upstream provider.
- Added metadata-only coding-agent observability across canonical request metadata, call logs, route-decision traces, Dashboard session summaries, and Route Explanation serialization.
- Added allowlisted safe coding-agent headers for session id, turn id, connector, repo label, and project label, with normalization/truncation instead of raw-header storage.
- Added Dashboard **Agents** recent-session summaries with request count, cost, latency, connector/repo/project breakdowns, and links to session traces.
- Added connector logo assets and seven-locale Dashboard copy for the new Coding Agent Gateway connectors, virtual model labels, setup snippets, privacy copy, empty states, and errors.
- Added `docs/CODING_AGENT_GATEWAY.md` with connector setup, safe headers, virtual aliases, and the Engineering PR Review Workspace North Star demo.

### Changed

- Updated `/v1/models` agent-profile virtual model exposure so Gateway API keys can see profile `smart_model_id` values plus the coding aliases when `allow_auto` permits smart routing.
- Updated Agent Profile rendering to prefer coding aliases for coding-agent connectors while preserving existing Cherry Studio, Hermes, OpenClaw, Claude-style, and generic connector compatibility.
- Updated Dashboard sessions APIs to group by `agent_session_id` when present and to filter by `agent_connector`, `agent_repo`, and `agent_project`.
- Updated docs, README positioning, API reference, Dashboard docs, and release metadata to v2.1.0.

### Boundaries

- Coding Agent Gateway does not store source code, prompts, responses, diffs, tool payloads, raw repository content, raw provider headers, provider keys, Gateway API key plaintext, hidden reasoning text, media bytes, or resolved secrets by default.
- Coding aliases are advisory and profile-scoped. They do not bypass workspace isolation, RBAC, Gateway API key permissions, budgets, allowed models/nodes/modalities, circuit breakers, fallback policy, or audit boundaries.
- v2.1.0 does not add a workflow engine, hosted cloud dependency, provider-key exposure in agent configs, or coding-agent vendor lock-in.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Shipped Platform Trust GA for the OSS data plane: workspace isolation, local Dashboard RBAC, optional OIDC login and invites, PostgreSQL production guidance, Redis shared-state cluster mode, management audit logs, upgrade hardening, and repeatable benchmark evidence are now the stable v2.0 baseline.
- Added a Dashboard first-run checklist that guides operators through active workspace, provider node, Gateway API key, first request, and logs/route/cost evidence without adding new storage or hosted dependencies.
- Added committed GA sample benchmark reports in JSON and Markdown under `docs/reports/`.

### Changed

- Finalized README and docs positioning around "open-source AI infrastructure platform for teams and agents".
- Updated `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` with v2.0.0 GA benchmark methodology and report links while keeping the rc.2 report as release-candidate history.
- Updated release metadata to v2.0.0 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, release-version sync coverage, and benchmark script output.
- Reviewed seven-locale Dashboard copy for the GA first-run path: `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`.

### Fixed

- Restored OpenAI-style Responses cache accounting for providers that report cache hits under `usage.input_tokens_details.cached_tokens`, so TokenFlux/OpenAI-compatible responses now propagate cached-token usage into gateway responses, streaming serializers, and `call_logs.cache_read_input_tokens` instead of silently dropping provider-side cache hits.
- Moved the Dashboard theme bootstrap out of inline HTML so the production app stays compatible with Helmet's default content-security policy without console CSP errors.

### Boundaries

- v2.0.0 GA does not add API resale/recharge flows, mandatory cloud dependency, SCIM/LDAP, organization billing, full DAG workflow orchestration, or broad provider-count expansion.
- The first-run checklist and benchmark reports do not store prompts, responses, raw provider headers, provider keys, media bytes, tool payloads, hidden reasoning text, or resolved secrets by default.

## 2.0.0-rc.2 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added `npm run benchmark:platform`, a deterministic local benchmark harness that starts a mock upstream plus real SiftGate AppModule instances and measures direct mock, non-streaming proxy, streaming proxy, `model=auto` smart routing, metadata-only call-log write, and Dashboard benchmark-report read overhead.
- Added optional benchmark coverage for PostgreSQL production metadata mode, Redis shared-state/cluster mode, and live direct-upstream baselines when explicit environment variables are provided.
- Added committed rc.2 sample benchmark reports in JSON and Markdown under `docs/reports/`.
- Added unit coverage for the platform benchmark script, including JSON/Markdown output, privacy flags, measured SQLite scenarios, and skipped optional Postgres/Redis behavior.

### Changed

- Expanded `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` with v2.0.0-rc.2 benchmark methodology, environment variables, scenario definitions, limitations, rerun instructions, and GA re-measurement requirements.
- Added `benchmark:platform` alongside the existing `benchmark:upstream` command so deterministic local measurements and existing-gateway/live-upstream measurements are clearly separated.
- Updated release metadata to v2.0.0-rc.2 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

### Boundaries

- rc.2 benchmark numbers are release-candidate measurements from a local deterministic mock upstream. They must be re-measured before v2.0.0 GA if runtime behavior changes.
- The benchmark harness and reports do not store prompts, responses, raw provider headers, provider keys, media bytes, tool payloads, hidden reasoning text, or resolved secrets by default.

## 2.0.0-rc.1 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added workspace-scoped platform management audit events for Dashboard management operations, including actor id/type, organization/workspace, action, resource type/id, redacted before/after summaries, request id, timestamp, result status, metadata, and hash-chain fields.
- Added centralized audit writing and RBAC-denied audit coverage so successful, failed, and denied management operations have consistent metadata-only evidence.
- Added the Dashboard Audit Log page with filters, event details, hash-chain evidence, and seven-locale copy for `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`.
- Added `GET /api/dashboard/audit` and OpenAPI response schemas for management audit event lists, pagination, and explicit privacy flags.
- Added `management_audit_events` schema creation and SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration coverage.

### Changed

- `siftgate migrate-v2 --dry-run` now supports `--output`, `--report`, `--out`, and `-o` for writing the stable JSON dry-run report to disk without mutating production data.
- Config audit bridge events now also write redacted platform management audit entries where appropriate, while preserving existing local config audit and rollback behavior.
- Updated production, Dashboard, API reference, v1.9-to-v2 migration, README, OpenAPI, Kubernetes, Helm, and release metadata to v2.0.0-rc.1.

### Boundaries

- Management audit rows do not store provider keys, Gateway API key plaintext, prompts, responses, raw provider headers, media bytes, tool payloads, hidden reasoning text, or resolved secrets by default.
- Audit logs are read-only from the Dashboard and remain local to the OSS data plane.

## 2.0.0-beta.1 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added optional generic OIDC Dashboard login with discovery, authorization-code callback handling, userinfo identity mapping, allowed-domain checks, default role/workspace mapping, and local Dashboard JWT issuance.
- Added OIDC config under `dashboard.oidc` plus `dashboard.session_secret` support for stable Dashboard sessions when OIDC is enabled without a local password.
- Added workspace invitation metadata with role, workspace, optional email, expiry, status, one-time plain invite link return, SHA-256 token hashing at rest, local-login acceptance, OIDC acceptance, and revoke/list Dashboard APIs.
- Added Members page invitation creation/list/revoke UI and Login page SSO entry with seven-locale copy for `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`.
- Added provider docs/templates for Google, GitHub OIDC-capable setups, and Azure AD / Entra ID.

### Changed

- `GET /api/auth/status` now returns local login and privacy-safe OIDC public status metadata while preserving the existing `authRequired` field.
- Dashboard auth remains backwards-compatible: installs without `dashboard.password` or OIDC stay open, and local password login still works when configured.
- Updated config examples, env examples, production docs, security docs, and release metadata to v2.0.0-beta.1.

### Boundaries

- OIDC is disabled by default, does not require SiftGate Cloud, and does not force SSO for local installs.
- OIDC client secrets are resolved through the existing secret-reference path and are never returned by Dashboard APIs.
- No SCIM, LDAP, or built-in email delivery was added in this release.
- Invitation and OIDC state do not store prompts, responses, raw provider headers, provider keys, media bytes, tool payloads, hidden reasoning text, resolved secrets, or reusable invite tokens by default.

## 2.0.0-alpha.4 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added coherent Redis shared-state cluster mode for multi-instance OSS data-plane deployments with workspace-scoped runtime keys: `<prefix>ws:<workspace-id>:<category>:<key>`.
- Added per-category state backend policies and TTLs for `rate_limit`, `circuit_breaker`, `cache_affinity`, `momentum`, `prompt_cache`, `concurrency`, `health_probe`, and `realtime_session`.
- Added shared Redis-backed runtime coordination for API/login rate limits, circuit state, cache affinity, routing momentum, prompt cache lookups, metadata-only concurrency summaries, metadata-only active health probe summaries, and metadata-only realtime/session summaries.
- Added `GET /api/dashboard/cluster` for authenticated Dashboard viewers to inspect privacy-safe local node id, state backend, Redis connectivity, recent state errors, instance count, and per-category policy/TTL status even when cluster mode is disabled.
- Added a Dashboard cluster state summary card with seven-locale copy for `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`.

### Changed

- `GET /cluster/status` remains the operator endpoint for enabled Redis-backed cluster mode, while Dashboard now uses the always-available privacy-safe local summary endpoint.
- Updated production, state-backend, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, config example, and environment example docs with alpha.4 Redis shared-state and cluster-mode guidance.
- Updated release metadata to v2.0.0-alpha.4 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

### Boundaries

- Redis remains optional. Single-node memory state, local SQLite startup, local Dashboard login, and Docker quickstart behavior remain unchanged.
- Redis shared state does not store prompts, responses, raw provider headers, provider keys, media bytes, tool payloads, hidden reasoning text, or resolved secrets by default. Prompt-cache response storage still requires the existing explicit cache opt-in.

## 2.0.0-alpha.3 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added a hardened PostgreSQL production path with connection-pool settings, SSL options, fail-fast database config validation, and redacted startup diagnostics.
- Added `/ready` for load balancers and Kubernetes readiness probes. It checks database availability only, while `/health` continues to report provider/node degradation separately.
- Added database health details to `/health`, including database type, redacted target, connectivity, latency, synchronize mode, pool summary, and SSL summary.
- Added PostgreSQL pool/SSL config examples across `gateway.config.example.yaml`, `.env.example`, Docker Compose, Helm values, and Kubernetes Secret examples.
- Added tests for PostgreSQL config validation, TypeORM option generation, database health/readiness behavior, and RBAC workspace membership migration coverage.

### Changed

- Kubernetes and Docker Compose readiness/healthcheck defaults now use `/ready` so upstream provider degradation does not remove an otherwise healthy gateway instance from service.
- SQLite remains the default local/dev database with schema sync enabled; PostgreSQL now defaults to `synchronize: false` in runtime option generation unless explicitly overridden.
- SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration now includes `workspace_memberships` so alpha.2 RBAC data is preserved on production migration.
- Updated production, state-backend, Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm docs with backup, migration, readiness, pool, SSL, and validation guidance.
- Updated release metadata to v2.0.0-alpha.3 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

### Boundaries

- SQLite support and the zero-friction local quickstart remain unchanged.
- No new ORM or migration framework was introduced.
- PostgreSQL integration tests are skipped unless a local PostgreSQL service is explicitly available; deterministic config and migration tests cover the generated production path.

## 2.0.0-alpha.2 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added local Dashboard RBAC for workspace governance with `admin`, `operator`, and `viewer` roles backed by a new `workspace_memberships` table.
- Bootstrapped the existing local Dashboard identity as an active Admin in `default-workspace` during fresh installs and v1.9-to-v2 upgrades.
- Added centralized Dashboard permission helpers, decorators, and guards so role checks are shared across Dashboard controllers instead of being implemented ad hoc.
- Added Dashboard member APIs: `GET /api/dashboard/members` and `PUT /api/dashboard/members/:id` for Admin-managed local role updates.
- Added a Dashboard Members page, role badges in the header, and permission-aware disabled controls/tooltips for high-risk management actions.
- Added seven-locale RBAC and member-management copy for `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`.

### Changed

- Dashboard read APIs default to Viewer access, operational writes require Operator where safe, and Admin-only actions cover member management, Gateway API keys, budgets, teams, workspace settings, destructive operations, and config rollback.
- Added a guardrail that prevents disabling or demoting the last active workspace Admin.
- Updated release metadata to v2.0.0-alpha.2 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

### Boundaries

- SSO/OIDC, custom permission expressions, invitations, and cloud/enterprise identity features remain out of scope for alpha.2.
- Provider secrets, raw headers, prompts, responses, media bytes, tool payloads, hidden reasoning text, and resolved secrets remain excluded from Dashboard role responses and member APIs.

## 2.0.0-alpha.1 - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Introduced the Workspace Core foundation with local `organizations` and `workspaces` entities, default `default-org` / `default-workspace` bootstrap, and safe default workspace mapping for fresh installs and v1.9 upgrades.
- Added workspace ownership metadata across persisted API keys, local teams, budgets, nodes/status projections, agent profiles, call logs, route decision traces, eval metadata, batch jobs, MCP/shadow/provider-compatibility/video/config metadata, and related dashboard services.
- Added workspace context resolution for Dashboard sessions and Gateway API keys, including safe fallback to `default-workspace` for legacy keys and rows without a workspace id.
- Added Dashboard workspace APIs: `GET /api/dashboard/workspaces` and `POST /api/dashboard/workspaces/switch`.
- Added a compact Dashboard header workspace selector and workspace-aware Dashboard API client headers with seven-locale copy for `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`.
- Added unit and E2E coverage for default workspace bootstrap, migration backfill, context resolution, legacy API key compatibility, and Dashboard workspace filtering.

### Changed

- Extended the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migrator to include default organization/workspace rows and normalize workspace-scoped rows into `default-workspace` when migrating v1.9-style databases.
- Updated migration, Dashboard, and roadmap documentation for the alpha.1 workspace foundation while preserving the v1.9.2 read-only dry-run contract.
- Updated release metadata to v2.0.0-alpha.1 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

### Boundaries

- RBAC, OIDC, invitations, organization billing, full multi-workspace provisioning, and production PostgreSQL hardening remain scheduled for later v2.0 prompts.
- Existing `/v1/*` ingress compatibility, legacy Gateway API keys, local SQLite startup, Docker quickstart behavior, and metadata-only privacy boundaries are preserved.

## 1.9.2 - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Added `docs/MIGRATION_V1_TO_V2.md` to document how existing v1.9 single-tenant config and metadata rows will map into the future v2 default organization/workspace.
- Added a read-only `siftgate migrate-v2 --dry-run` CLI command with stable JSON and human-readable output for API keys, local teams, namespaces, nodes, budgets, routing policies, agent profiles, call logs, eval rows, MCP servers, batch jobs, and Dashboard user counts.
- Added fixture coverage for a v1.9-style gateway config plus dry-run tests for normal SQLite, empty SQLite, missing SQLite, PostgreSQL planning, missing config blockers, CLI JSON output, dry-run enforcement, and human-readable formatting.

### Changed

- Updated release metadata to v1.9.2 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

## 1.9.1 - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Added the v2.x platform roadmap for the OSS Data Plane, positioning SiftGate as an AI infrastructure platform for teams and agents while keeping the v2.0.0 Platform Trust scope separate from later minor-release capabilities.
- Added a release checklist covering version sync files, required tests, seven-locale review, branch/PR/merge/tag/GitHub release steps, rollback discipline, and privacy review.
- Added `docs/V2_EXECUTION_PROMPTS.md` as the prompt runbook for the v2.x release train.
- Added a read-only `npm run release:check` command that verifies release version alignment across packages, OpenAPI metadata, Helm, Kubernetes, README, and changelog without pushing, tagging, or creating releases.

### Changed

- Updated release metadata to v1.9.1 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, README, package locks, and release-version sync coverage.

## 1.9.0 - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Released Agent Gateway Profiles for the MIT OSS Data Plane with a first-class Dashboard **Agents** page and local Dashboard APIs for creating, editing, deleting, listing, and rendering agent/client connection profiles.
- Added connector templates for Codex, Claude Code, Cherry Studio, Hermes, OpenClaw, Generic OpenAI-compatible clients, and Generic Anthropic-compatible clients so agents and chatbot tools can use SiftGate without guessing base URLs or model wiring.
- Added profile-scoped smart virtual models, including `claude-siftgate-auto`, so Claude-style clients can request a connector-safe model that maps to internal smart routing instead of direct Claude model routing.
- Added secret-safe rendered configs that use Gateway API key placeholders and masked metadata only; provider keys remain in Nodes, env vars, or secret references and stored Gateway API key plaintext is never exposed.
- Added full seven-language Dashboard localization for Agent Profiles across `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `th`, and `es`, plus a static Agent Profiles localization check in the frontend test chain.
- Added real connector identity assets for the Agent Profiles picker, including Codex, Claude Code, Cherry Studio, Hermes Agent, OpenClaw, Generic OpenAI, and Generic Anthropic.

### Changed

- Agent Profile traffic reuses existing SiftGate governance and observability: Gateway API keys, namespaces, budgets, rate limits, endpoint/model/node/modality policy, metadata-only logs, sessions, route explanations, and MCP endpoint permissions all continue to apply.
- `/v1/models` now exposes Agent Profile virtual models only in the matching active profile and Gateway API key context.
- Smart-router-only Agent Profile model listings now avoid exposing direct/provider model clutter to clients such as Cherry Studio, while direct routing in the Dashboard can select from configured node models instead of relying on free-text model entry.
- Dashboard Logs now distinguishes streaming vs sync delivery and labels request duration as total response time, reducing confusion when streamed answers take longer because more content is returned.
- The Agent Profiles edit dialog layout was tightened for CJK locales, with aligned connector logos, stable connector card rows, and top-aligned API key/status/namespace fields.
- Release metadata is aligned to v1.9.0 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes base manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, and release-version sync coverage.

## 1.8.5 - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- Fixed the Dashboard API key and local team permission picker layout so the allowed endpoint/modality selectors no longer overlap in the create/edit modal at constrained widths or in CJK locales.
- Improved permission picker selection ergonomics with a clearer "all items" state, bounded selected chips, and visible-item select/deselect controls across all Dashboard locales.

## 1.8.4 - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- Preserved explicit routing order for Responses-compatible targets so configured smart-routing priority remains stable when resolving upstream compatibility.

## 1.8.3 - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- Clarified Dashboard call logs by renaming the source-format column to ingress protocol and adding a separate upstream protocol column derived from the configured node protocol, so GPT/Claude requests entering through Chat Completions no longer appear to be forwarded with the wrong upstream API.
- Updated log detail localization across Dashboard locales so ingress protocol and upstream protocol are consistently distinguishable in expanded call log rows.

## 1.8.2 - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- Fixed Responses upstream request denormalization so assistant history is forwarded with `output_text` content parts while user content remains `input_text`, preventing OpenAI Responses-compatible gateways from rejecting multi-turn direct GPT requests and triggering unintended fallback chains.

## 1.8.0 - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Released the v1.8.0 Canonical Catalog Normalization + Node UX Cleanup minor for the MIT OSS Data Plane, focusing on unifying provider/model source-of-truth boundaries, reducing stale catalog defaults, and making the Dashboard operator path clearer without introducing cloud-only dependencies.
- Added an internal OpenRouter-first canonical model registry materialization layer on top of the existing catalog refresh/sync pipeline, so SiftGate can keep one primary canonical model dataset for ids, aliases, architecture, supported parameters, context, top-provider metadata, and reference pricing without turning that registry into a second operator-facing catalog.
- Added a stricter ZeroEval canonical enrichment overlay with explicit match strategy, match confidence, matched-from evidence, and diagnostics for unmatched or low-confidence rows, allowing lifecycle, throughput, benchmark, multimodal/spec, and secondary pricing metadata to attach to canonical models instead of only a few built-in exact provider/model matches.
- Added provider-projection metadata and Dashboard API fields for `provider_status`, `default_visible`, `replacement_provider_id`, `canonical_model_coverage`, `pricing_coverage`, `recommended_model_buckets`, `recommended_models`, `latest_model_hints`, `enrichment_summary`, `canonical_id`, `projection_source`, `lifecycle`, `specs`, `benchmarks`, `pricing_sources`, and `match_confidence`.
- Added shared catalog signal UI across Nodes, Add Node, and Provider Catalog so operators now see consistent status badges, canonical/pricing coverage, recommended model previews, and trust-copy about OpenRouter and ZeroEval reference pricing.

### Changed

- OpenRouter sync no longer acts only like an `openrouter` provider refresh. It now drives the internal canonical model primary dataset, while the merged provider catalog remains the single public operator-facing surface.
- ZeroEval enrichment now layers onto canonical models first, then flows through provider projections. OpenRouter reference pricing remains primary, ZeroEval pricing remains secondary and review-required, and the established pricing precedence is unchanged: explicit `nodes[].model_capabilities.<model>.pricing`, `models_pricing`, `catalog.override.yaml`, sync cache, then built-in/fallback catalog references.
- Built-in static provider model lists were demoted from primary truth to transport seed/fallback/reference data when canonical projections exist. Historical stale provider/model rows are now classified as `active`, `transport_only`, `deprecated`, `legacy_alias`, or `custom` instead of continuing to look equally authoritative in the default UI path.
- Dashboard Nodes now separates configured upstreams from catalog onboarding; Add Node now defaults to active providers and canonical recommended buckets instead of stale alphabetical model guesses; Provider Catalog now explains catalog truth, coverage, and trust signals without presenting multiple competing provider/model truths.
- Release metadata is aligned to v1.8.0 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes manifest, OpenAPI document metadata, and release-version sync coverage.

## 1.7.0 - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Released the v1.7.0 Catalog Enrichment + Fresh Model Defaults minor for the MIT OSS Data Plane, focusing on fresher catalog-backed model metadata, better default model recommendations, and pricing-prefill ergonomics instead of horizontal provider-count expansion or cloud-only features.
- Added a ZeroEval-backed catalog enrichment adapter to the existing refresh/sync pipeline so SiftGate can ingest third-party reference metadata for already-known provider/model pairs, write it into the managed local sync cache, and expose the source in CLI sync status and Dashboard catalog APIs without making ZeroEval a runtime dependency.
- Added v1.7 model enrichment metadata to the merged catalog schema and Dashboard catalog APIs, including lifecycle fields, specs, benchmark containers, source metadata, and operator-visible enrichment summaries for future provider/model governance surfaces.
- Added backend-generated `recommended_model_buckets`, `latest_model_hints`, and `recommended_models` to provider catalog responses so Dashboard Add Node defaults can prefer newer stable models with usable pricing metadata while preserving the full model list for search and manual edits.
- Added Provider Catalog and Add Node operator-facing enrichment UI for release date, max context, throughput, selected benchmark snippets, and trust-copy that explains catalog pricing is a review-required default reference rather than a billing authority.

### Changed

- Dashboard Add Node now defaults model buckets and pricing rows from the new recommended-model metadata instead of naively taking the first alphabetically sorted catalog models, which prevents common stale-snapshot defaults when merged catalog data is fresher than built-in ordering.
- Merged catalog pricing prefill now accepts ZeroEval reference input/output pricing for supported provider/model mappings and normalizes it into existing token price fields, while keeping the established pricing precedence unchanged: explicit `nodes[].model_capabilities.<model>.pricing`, `models_pricing`, `catalog.override.yaml`, sync cache, then built-in catalog.
- Catalog sync status, refresh-source reporting, config validation, tests, and CLI help now recognize ZeroEval alongside OpenRouter while keeping OpenRouter's existing adapter behavior unchanged.
- Release metadata is aligned to v1.7.0 across the root package, Dashboard package, TypeScript client, Python package, Helm chart, Kubernetes manifest, and release-version sync coverage.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Released the v1.6.0 Provider Cache Intelligence minor for the MIT OSS Data Plane, focusing on provider-cache-aware usage normalization, operator-visible savings, and cache-aware routing bias instead of new provider breadth or cloud-only features.
- Added a provider usage-schema registry on compatibility profiles so SiftGate can declare official response paths for usage, cache-read, and cache-write token fields instead of hardcoding every provider family inside the transport layer.
- Added provider-cache savings analytics for the OSS Dashboard, including `GET /api/dashboard/cache-savings`, grouped savings/hit-rate summaries, daily trends, and a new `cost_without_cache_usd` call-log field for actual-vs-no-cache comparisons.
- Added Dashboard cache-savings visualizations across Overview, Analytics, Logs, and Budget so operators can see provider-cache savings, hit rate, cost mix, and per-request cache evidence without exposing prompts, responses, raw headers, or provider keys.
- Added cache session affinity routing for provider-cache-capable nodes, including per-session route history, optional Redis-backed state hydration, TTL-aware affinity activation, and Route Decision evidence for affinity reason, bonus, TTL, last hit age, and estimated hit probability.

### Changed

- Non-streaming provider normalization and the chat/responses/messages stream parsers now resolve usage fields from compatibility-profile schemas first, while preserving the previous hardcoded extraction path as a backward-compatible fallback for nodes without a known profile.
- Responses streaming serialization now writes both `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` and legacy `usage.input_token_details.cached_tokens` so modern OpenAI-style cache accounting and older SDK expectations stay aligned.
- Refreshed built-in cache-aware pricing references from official docs for Gemini 3.1 preview models and DeepSeek v4 compatibility mappings, and re-verified the current OpenAI and Anthropic cache pricing metadata.
- Call logs now persist cache-aware and no-cache cost views together, while the SQLite/PostgreSQL schema patch and SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migrator both recognize the new `cost_without_cache_usd` column.
- Balanced, cost, and least-latency routing can now apply a bounded cache-affinity bonus when the same session recently confirmed provider-side cache hits on a matching node/model, while still respecting circuit-breaker availability and fallback behavior.
- Route Explanation, localization bundles, and the example gateway config now document cache-affinity routing so Dashboard evidence, config validation, and release docs stay aligned for v1.6.0 operators.

### Fixed

- The `cost_without_cache_usd` schema patch now skips empty databases that do not have `call_logs` yet, avoiding a startup-time `ALTER TABLE` failure on incomplete SQLite/PostgreSQL setups.

## 1.5.0 - 2026-05-05

### Changed

- Released the v1.5.0 Contract Hardening and Runtime Safety minor for the MIT OSS Data Plane, focusing on stable public contracts and safer runtime behavior instead of new provider breadth or cloud features.
- Tightened legacy `${VAR}` config interpolation so missing required env values now fail fast during startup and reload, while `${VAR:-default}` keeps explicit fallback semantics and `${env:VAR}` / Vault / AWS / GCP references keep runtime resolution behavior.
- Added one public gateway error mapping layer for OSS ingress so gateway-generated public errors keep consistent `message`, `type`, `request_id`, status semantics, and request-id headers without changing successful OpenAI / Anthropic / Batch / MCP / Video response shapes.
- Extended request-id consistency across gateway-generated non-streaming and pre-controller error paths, including parser/body-limit failures, while preserving `x-siftgate-request-id` and legacy-compatible `x-request-id`.

### Fixed

- Hot reload, Dashboard reload, rollback restore, file-watcher reload, and `SIGHUP` now reject invalid configs atomically and keep the previously active config in memory instead of replacing it with a partially resolved or broken candidate.
- Updated OpenAPI error schema and release documentation so request-id and required-env behavior are documented consistently for v1.5.0 operators upgrading from the v1.4.x line.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- Released the v1.4.1 public contract consistency patch for the MIT OSS Data Plane without expanding scope into new features or breaking startup semantics.
- Unified public gateway request-id responses so gateway-generated responses now return `x-siftgate-request-id` while keeping `x-request-id` for backward compatibility, including Batch, MCP, streaming, and provider-compatible ingress paths.
- Hardened gateway-generated public error envelopes so OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, Batch, MCP, and Video gateway errors consistently expose `message`, `type`, and `request_id` while preserving the existing outer protocol shapes.
- Updated the TypeScript client and Python SDK to prefer `x-siftgate-request-id` and then fall back to `x-request-id` and `x-correlation-id`.
- Synced the published release version across the root package, the TypeScript client package, the Python package, and OpenAPI/Swagger metadata so `/openapi.json` no longer reports a stale `0.x` version.
- Added regression coverage for public request-id headers, SDK request-id extraction, OpenAPI version sync, gateway-generated error contracts, and cross-package release version alignment.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Expanded the built-in Provider Catalog for v1.4 to 50+ providers, adding Hugging Face, Cloudflare Workers AI, IBM watsonx.ai, Baseten, Lepton AI, Modal, RunPod, Predibase, Lamini, AI21 Labs, fal.ai, Stability AI, Black Forest Labs, Ideogram, Luma AI, Runway, Pika, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Cartesia, Speechmatics, LM Studio, llama.cpp server, TGI, SGLang, and Xinference.
- Added v1.4 provider governance metadata across the built-in catalog, including aliases, family/category, provider type, homepage/docs/pricing URLs, logo identity, input/output types, model buckets, batch modality metadata, compatibility profile, and review-required pricing source metadata.
- Added Dashboard/provider-logo identity coverage for the new providers so OpenAI-compatible or compatible-style providers do not fall back to the OpenAI logo.
- Added v1.4 Provider Catalog pricing source governance for the OSS Data Plane, with unified token/cache/media/rerank/realtime/batch pricing fields, source type, source URL, verification timestamps, confidence, stale windows, and review reasons.
- Added pricing evidence to Route Decision Trace and Dashboard Route Explanation, including source, confidence, stale status, resolver layer, missing price units, and estimated cost basis without exposing prompts, responses, raw headers, provider keys, or secrets.
- Added `siftgate catalog show <provider> --pricing` output for pricing governance details and extended catalog validation/export coverage for source-governed prices.
- Added Provider Catalog Dashboard UX 2.0 for the v1.4 provider ecosystem work: catalog responses now expose Dashboard-ready provider family, provider type, compatibility profile, aliases, logo id, links, model buckets, limits, and pricing-unit metadata without introducing a second catalog.
- Added a grouped Provider Catalog explorer with summary cards, family/type/modality/compatibility/price-source filters, stale/review quick filters, collapsed provider groups, detail panels, sync status, override markers, and 7-language operator copy.
- Added Add Node Wizard provider family filters, alias/model search, provider type badges, catalog identity logos, and a bounded scroll area so 50+ providers remain usable while advanced endpoint/header/pricing/health fields stay editable.
- Added v1.4 Provider Compatibility Profiles for the OSS Data Plane, with a local registry covering OpenAI-compatible, Responses-compatible, Anthropic Messages, Gemini, Vertex, Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, OpenRouter, Cohere, Mistral, Ollama, vLLM, TGI, LM Studio, media generation, speech, rerank, and embedding protocol styles.
- Added `nodes[].compatibility_profile` and Provider Catalog `compatibility_profiles`, with validation for unknown profiles, provider/profile mismatch, source-format mismatch, endpoint mismatch, and modality/model-bucket mismatch.
- Added compatibility-profile routing evidence so Route Decision Trace and Dashboard Route Explanation can show selected/filtered profiles, endpoint/protocol strategy, passthrough fields, downgraded fields, unsupported fields, and profile filter reasons without storing prompts, responses, raw headers, provider keys, media bytes, or video bytes.
- Added compatibility-profile-aware safe probes for the Provider Compatibility Matrix, including batch endpoint/auth probing alongside chat, responses, messages, embeddings, rerank, images, audio, video, and realtime.
- Added Dashboard Provider Catalog, Nodes, Add Node Wizard, Route Explanation, and Logs localization for compatibility profile metadata across all seven OSS Dashboard languages.
- Added `docs/PROVIDER_COMPATIBILITY.md` and updated API, architecture, dashboard, provider catalog, config example, and CLI documentation for compatibility profiles.

### Changed

- Unified legacy provider catalog diagnostics with the merged built-in Provider Catalog so Dashboard APIs, Add Node Wizard presets, catalog CLI, and config validation all read the same provider/model data.
- Config validation now reports catalog auth-type mismatches for known providers and marks unknown providers as custom catalog entries without blocking single-node startup.
- Cost and balanced routing, Benchmark reports, config validation, Dashboard catalog APIs, catalog overrides, sync cache, and built-in catalog fallback now use the same pricing resolver priority: explicit node/model pricing, `models_pricing`, `catalog.override.yaml`, sync cache, then built-in catalog.
- Dashboard and docs use “Price source status”, “Review required”, and “Stale” wording for operator-facing pricing copy; internal `pricing_hygiene` fields remain for API compatibility.
- Dashboard Logs and Route Explanation candidate tables now render provider identity icons from node/model hints so compatible providers remain visually distinct from OpenAI fallbacks.

## 1.3.2 - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Added a localized, animated Dashboard Sidebar scroll hint that appears only while additional navigation items remain below the visible scroll area.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- Fixed Dashboard Sidebar overflow when the navigation list grows beyond the viewport. The logo and health/language footer now stay visible while the middle navigation region scrolls independently.
- Stabilized the local e2e quality gate by running e2e suites serially, avoiding shared temporary config races between Dashboard reload and realtime WebSocket tests.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Added v1.3 local Virtual Key + Team management for the OSS Data Plane. Dashboard-generated Gateway API keys can now bind to local teams with team-level namespace, allowed node/model, endpoint/modality, budget, and rate-limit policy.
- Added `local_teams` persistence on SQLite/PostgreSQL, `team_id` attribution in call logs, and team-scoped budget rules that are checked alongside global, namespace, and key budgets.
- Added Dashboard APIs `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/dashboard/teams` with sanitized audit events for team create/update/delete, plus 7-language Dashboard Team management UI on the API Keys page.
- Added migration coverage for local teams and key/team metadata while preserving one-time-only Gateway API key secret behavior and masked list responses.
- Added the v1.3 local Evaluation Framework preview for the OSS Data Plane, with metadata-only dataset, experiment run, and per-sample result storage on SQLite/PostgreSQL.
- Added LLM-as-judge primary-vs-candidate comparison through the normal SiftGate routing pipeline, reporting success, latency, cost, fallback, judge score, and winner without introducing hosted enterprise services.
- Added Dashboard APIs `GET /api/dashboard/evals/reports`, `GET /api/dashboard/evals/reports/:id`, and local automation endpoint `POST /api/dashboard/evals/runs`.
- Added a read-only Dashboard Eval Reports page with 7-language localization and static frontend checks.
- Added config validation and example settings for `evaluation.store_samples`; prompt/response previews remain disabled by default and require explicit opt-in plus redaction.
- Added SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration coverage for `eval_datasets`, `eval_experiment_runs`, and `eval_sample_results`.
- Added v1.3 Semantic Cache preview with disabled-by-default local memory similarity metadata, namespace/API key/model/team isolation, Route Explanation evidence, and optional replay only when `semantic_cache.store_responses=true`.
- Added `docs:check`, a static documentation safety check for required community assets, broken relative Markdown links, private repository references, committed `gateway.config.yaml`, and common secret patterns.
- Added Quickstart, SDKs, Playground, Batch, Caching, Security, contribution, code of conduct, issue template, and PR template community assets for the OSS Data Plane.

### Changed

- Reworked README as a concise open-source product entry for v1.3.0 and removed private/enterprise repository references from the public entrypoint.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Added v1.2 MCP Gateway preview with local `mcp.servers` registry, `POST /mcp/:serverId` JSON-RPC proxying, Gateway API key auth, endpoint permission checks, namespace allow-lists, rate limiting, and secret-reference-aware upstream headers.
- Added `GET /api/dashboard/mcp` plus a Dashboard MCP Gateway page showing local MCP servers, static tools, recent metadata-only calls, and error summaries without storing tool input/output, raw headers, provider keys, or resolved secret values.
- Added MCP config validation, frontend 7-language localization, Dashboard static checks, and unit coverage for proxy privacy, permission enforcement, namespace enforcement, and config diagnostics.
- Added the v1.2 OpenAI-compatible Batch API proxy with `POST /v1/batches`, `GET /v1/batches/:id`, `POST /v1/batches/:id/cancel`, `GET /v1/batches/:id/output`, and `GET /v1/batches/:id/errors`.
- Added local `batch_jobs` metadata storage for request id, provider batch id, node/model hint, endpoint, file ids, request counts, status, timestamps, API key/namespace attribution, metadata keys, and sanitized errors without storing input JSONL, output JSONL, raw headers, provider keys, or file bytes.
- Added Dashboard Batch Jobs page and `GET /api/dashboard/batches`, including 7-language localization, endpoint permission copy, read-only filters, status cards, and privacy/static frontend checks.
- Added Batch endpoint configuration fields, config validation, SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration coverage, call-log/benchmark source-format support, and e2e coverage for create/status/cancel/output proxying and endpoint-permission enforcement.
- Added v1.2 prompt-cache-aware routing evidence for the OSS Data Plane. Routing now records local prompt-cache lookup state, provider prompt-cache/read-cache/write-cache capability, observed provider cache-read hit rate, cache read/write token counters, cache-adjusted cost estimates, and cache savings in Route Decision Trace without storing prompts, responses, raw headers, provider keys, media bytes, or video bytes.
- Added cache-aware Dashboard Route Explanation evidence, Logs cache routing-effect copy, and Benchmark cache-impact summaries with 7-language localization.
- Added prompt-cache capability flags (`prompt_cache`, `read_cache`, `write_cache`) to node/model capability schema and cache read/write pricing metadata for model pricing/catalog fallback.
- Added the v1.2 Model Pricing Sync framework for the OSS Data Plane. Catalog sync is disabled by default, requires explicit provider adapters, initially supports OpenRouter only, and can write public model/pricing metadata into a SiftGate-managed local cache without overwriting operator `catalog.override.yaml` entries.
- Added `siftgate catalog sync openrouter`, local catalog sync-cache merge support, Dashboard sync status metadata, and config validation warnings for missing or unsupported sync adapters.

### Changed

- Cost and balanced optimization can prefer provider paths with lower cache-read prices or observed provider cache hits while preserving the existing local prompt cache short-circuit behavior.
- Benchmark cache rates now include local prompt-cache hits and provider cache-read hits, with separate provider/local breakdowns in `cache_summary`.
- Provider Catalog responses now include scheduled sync status, last sync time, source URL, confidence, and stale state so operators can tell which prices came from automatic sync, docs review, local cache, or explicit override.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Added the v1.1 lightweight Python SDK scaffold under `packages/python`, with a stdlib-only synchronous `SiftGateClient`, typed package metadata, Gateway API key auth, routing hints, structured errors, raw response access, and helpers for models, chat completions, responses, messages, embeddings, rerank, images, audio, and async video jobs.
- Added Python SDK unit tests and the root `npm run test:python-sdk` quality-gate script for local package verification without publishing to PyPI.
- Added a v1.1 Dashboard Playground page for operator-triggered safe probes across chat, responses, messages, embeddings, rerank, images, audio, video, and realtime capability checks.
- Added `POST /api/dashboard/playground/run`, a dashboard-session protected probe endpoint that can apply a selected Gateway API key and namespace scope without exposing plaintext Gateway API keys to the browser.
- Added Playground result summaries for status, latency, usage, cost, response preview, and Route Decision deep links while keeping prompts, responses, raw headers, provider keys, media bytes, and realtime frames out of Playground persistence by default.
- Added 7-language Dashboard localization and frontend static checks for the Playground route, hook, endpoint coverage, privacy copy, and API types.
- Added v1.1 Session/Trace correlation for the OSS Dashboard, normalizing `session_id`, legacy `session_key`, W3C `traceparent`, and trace headers into call logs and route decision traces.
- Added read-only Dashboard APIs `GET /api/dashboard/sessions` and `GET /api/dashboard/sessions/:sessionId` for metadata-only session timelines across call logs, route decisions, shadow results, and recent guardrails findings.
- Added the Dashboard Session View with 7-language localization, namespace/API key/model/source filters, model-switch/fallback/cost/latency summaries, and deep links into Route Explanation without storing prompts, responses, raw headers, provider keys, or media/video bytes.
- Added runnable v1.1 agent framework examples under `examples/agents` for OpenAI SDK `base_url`, LangChain, CrewAI, and OpenAI Agents SDK.
- Added shared example headers for Gateway API keys, advisory routing hints, local namespace labels, session correlation, trace labels, and structured-output intent without committing real provider keys.
- Added `docs/AGENT_INTEGRATIONS.md` and static coverage to explain how operators inspect agent cost, fallback, route explanation, session correlation, and namespace policy through SiftGate.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Expanded the built-in Provider / Model Catalog toward v1.0 ecosystem coverage with 30+ providers, adding AWS Bedrock, Alibaba Qwen/Tongyi, Baidu Qianfan/Wenxin, Volcengine Ark/Doubao, Zhipu GLM, Moonshot/Kimi, MiniMax, Tencent Hunyuan, 01.AI/Yi, Replicate, Perplexity, NVIDIA NIM, Cerebras, and SambaNova Cloud.
- Added review-required pricing source metadata for the new providers, including source URLs, `last_updated`, `pricing_confidence`, and manual-review state without using placeholder wording in operator-facing catalog data.
- Added provider identity mappings and tests so new OpenAI-compatible or compatible-style providers do not fall back to the OpenAI logo in Dashboard node/catalog surfaces.
- Added v1.0 canonical reasoning/thinking intent for Chat `reasoning_effort`, Responses `reasoning`, Anthropic Messages `thinking`, and Gemini-style `thinking_config`.
- Added reasoning-aware provider forwarding strategies, routing preference for `supports_reasoning` targets, call-log metadata, external log sink fields, control-plane metadata, and Route Explanation evidence without storing prompts, responses, hidden reasoning text, raw headers, or provider keys.
- Added Dashboard Logs and Route Explanation localization for reasoning intent, effort, budget, strategy, support status, and downgrade notes across all 7 OSS Dashboard languages.
- Upgraded the official guardrails plugin to v1.0 with metadata-only webhook finding delivery, per-rule `webhook` actions, debounce/retry/timeout/max-queue/drop-policy controls, expanded PII, secret/token, jailbreak, unsafe URL, strict schema, and tool-call policy rules.
- Added `GET /api/dashboard/guardrails` and a Dashboard Guardrails summary card showing finding counters and recent webhook state without exposing prompts, responses, matched text, raw headers, provider keys, webhook URLs, webhook headers, media bytes, or video bytes.
- Hardened the OSS Dashboard API Key management surface for v1.0 with local create/edit/disable/delete/rotate flows, one-time full-key copy, masked list values, namespace binding, per-key budgets, per-key rate limits, and status/last-used/calls/cost/error-rate summaries.
- Added API key permission controls for `allowed_endpoints` and `allowed_modalities`, enforced before routing/provider forwarding and reflected in `/v1/models` filtering.
- Added redacted config audit coverage for API key create/update/rotate/delete operations, plus tests to ensure one-time Gateway API key secrets are not persisted in audit metadata.

### Changed

- Dashboard Add Node presets, catalog CLI output, config validation, and legacy catalog diagnostics now recognize the v1.0 provider set while preserving local `catalog.override.yaml` as the path for operator-reviewed model and price overrides.
- Dashboard API key forms and tables now include endpoint/modality permission pickers and 7-language localization for the new controls.
- SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration now preserves Dashboard-managed API key endpoint and modality permission arrays when present.

## 0.9.3 - 2026-05-05

### Changed

- Improved the Dashboard Provider Catalog refresh-source section with collapsed-by-default source cards, pinned automatic/local override sources, summary badges, and 7-language copy so long provider lists no longer dominate the page.
- Rebalanced the Routing page layout so each tier shows the route lane first and expands load-balancing/split controls across the available width instead of crowding them into a narrow right column.
- Updated Dashboard Logs for the v0.9 surface: source format is visible in the table, route result is separated from upstream node, and prompt-cache hits now display as cache outcomes with no upstream call instead of fake `cached` tiers or `cache` nodes.
- Filtered prompt-cache synthetic rows out of Dashboard tier/node distribution charts while keeping them visible in cache metrics and recent-call activity.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Added Provider Catalog refresh-source metadata to Dashboard catalog APIs and the CLI, making it clear which providers can be refreshed automatically and which require docs review or local operator overrides.
- Added `siftgate catalog sources` and `siftgate catalog refresh openrouter --out catalog.override.yaml` for generating a local OpenRouter catalog override from the public model API, including prompt/completion pricing converted to USD per 1M tokens.
- Added catalog pricing `source_url` and `retrieved_at` metadata so Dashboard and validation can explain where pricing came from and when it was fetched.

### Changed

- Renamed Dashboard and operator-facing copy from "pricing hygiene" to "price source status" / "价格来源状态" while keeping the internal `pricing_hygiene` API field for compatibility.
- Updated built-in catalog pricing source labels from placeholder wording to review-required reference metadata, avoiding confusing "占位" UI language while still warning operators to verify production prices.
- Improved the Provider Catalog Dashboard layout with wrapped modality filters, stable table widths, horizontal scrolling, clearer source badges, confidence labels, source links, and a refresh-source section.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Dashboard provider icons now resolve from catalog/provider identity, base URL, node name, tags, and model buckets before protocol fallbacks, so Voyage AI, Jina AI, Together AI, Fireworks AI, vLLM, Azure OpenAI, and custom OpenAI-compatible nodes no longer incorrectly show the OpenAI logo.
- Added a provider-logo identity check to the frontend test suite to prevent `chat_completions` or `responses` protocol fallbacks from forcing the OpenAI mark for compatible providers.
- Provider compatibility probes for OpenAI Responses-style upstreams now use a safer minimal `max_output_tokens` value, aligning single-node test responses with the Dashboard compatibility matrix.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-05-04

### Added

- v0.9 local config audit and rollback for the OSS Data Plane with `config_versions` and `config_audit_events` persistence on SQLite/PostgreSQL.
- Dashboard APIs `GET /api/dashboard/config/versions`, `GET /api/dashboard/config/versions/:id`, `POST /api/dashboard/config/versions/:id/rollback`, and `GET /api/dashboard/config/audit-events`.
- Dashboard Config Audit page with sanitized version detail, audit event stream, and confirmation-based rollback.

- v0.9 official guardrails plugin upgrade for the OSS Data Plane, replacing the skeleton with disabled-by-default local PII detection/redaction/blocking, lightweight prompt-injection checks, schema validation helpers, named allow/block/redact policies, input/output hooks, and conservative streaming delta handling.
- Privacy-safe guardrails findings in the per-request plugin store, capped by `max_findings_per_request` and limited to metadata such as request id, rule, kind, action, count, and path without prompt text, response text, raw headers, provider keys, media bytes, or video bytes.
- Unit coverage for guardrails privacy behavior, PII redaction/blocking, prompt-injection blocking, schema validation, allow/block policy exceptions, stream delta handling, and hook executor store propagation.
- v0.9 OSS-only Helm chart under `deploy/helm/siftgate` with default single-node SQLite + memory state behavior and opt-in Redis, PostgreSQL, Ingress, HPA, PodDisruptionBudget, ServiceMonitor, existing Secret/ConfigMap, resources, and persistence settings.
- v0.9 Kustomize/plain Kubernetes base under `deploy/kubernetes/base` with placeholder-only Secrets, SQLite PVC, config mount, health probes, and no SiftGate Cloud or enterprise image dependency.

### Changed

- Dashboard config reload, node create/update/delete, routing edits, and Dashboard-managed API key mutations now record local audit metadata when config audit is enabled.
- Rollback snapshots store redacted safe YAML and rehydrate secrets only from matching current local config fields; unresolved redactions fail safely without writing the config file.
- Runtime config loading now preserves typed secret references such as `${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}` for request-time resolution while keeping legacy `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` startup interpolation compatible.
- Dashboard sanitized config keeps secret references visible as references, masks literal provider keys and sensitive headers, and never resolves secrets for display.
- Explicit shadow prompt/response sample storage now applies built-in redaction and `shadow.compare.sample_max_chars` truncation, and config validation warnings now call out the storage risk more clearly.
- `siftgate migrate` now supports `--to` and `--force`; `--overwrite` remains a backward-compatible alias.
- Cost-aware routing and cost accounting can fall back to merged Provider Catalog pricing when explicit node/model pricing and `models_pricing` are absent; explicit user config always wins.
- Config validation now warns for placeholder, stale, missing, and modality-unit-mismatched catalog pricing, including `routing.optimization=cost` cases with insufficient prices.

- Cost accounting can prefer node/model pricing overrides before falling back to `models_pricing`.
- Chat Completions and Responses normalization now preserves raw request bodies so fallback policies can inspect structured-output intent.
